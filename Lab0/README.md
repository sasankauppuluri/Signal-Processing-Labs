# Lab0

## Instructions
- Lab0 is not graded but submission is compulsory to set up GitHub and to get you familiar with MATLAB.
- Code has to be done in MATLAB.
- Clone this repository in your local machine.
- <strong> Do not commit after the deadline </strong>.
- Proper documentation is expected on how to run the files and explanation of the code or any theory questions.
- Whenever using plot function, label the axes and plot properly.
- Save the plots in the <strong> Result </strong> folder and code file inside <strong> Code </strong> folder.
- Final directory structure should look like: <br>
```
|_Inside cloned folder
    |_ Result

```

    

## Questions
1) Plot the following function using appropriate increments for x (try minimum 2 different increments): U(x - 2), x in [-10,10], where U is the unit step function

2) Write a function that takes a 3 dimensional matrix (MxNxP), separates into M 2D matrices of size (NxP) and averages out the matrices and return the average matrix. Solve this without any loops and experiment with atleast two combinations of (M,N,P).
